License-Text:

   NOTE! This copyright does *not* cover user programs that use qfeper
 services by normal system calls - this is merely considered normal use
 of qfeper, and does *not* fall under the heading of "derived work".
 Also note that the GPL below is copyrighted by the Free Software
 Foundation, but the instance of code that it refers to (qfeper)
 is copyrighted by me and others who actually wrote it.

 Also note that the only valid version of the GPL as far as qfeper
 is concerned is _this_ particular version of the license (ie v2, not
 v2.2 or v3.x or whatever), unless explicitly otherwise stated.
