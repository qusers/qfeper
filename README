# introduction
qfeper is a program to write the fep files used by Q pacakge.
for each state one topology file is needed. all information 
is read from topology files. the program need an input file
containing the number of states and the name of each topology
file. plus the number of q atom and an one to one map is also
needed. the command "./qfeper h" will print out the format of
instruction file. the program usage is as follow

        ./qfeper h               for instruction file format
        ./qfeper input           for creating fep file
        ./qfeper input p         for printing details information on std output 
        ./qfeper input s         for spliting the fep file to 2 states fep files 
        ./qfeper input sp(or ps) is also accepted to add both functions

# how it works
The reference state is the first topology file. all atom numbers
is translated to first state numbering. only the bond, angle, 
torsion, and improper will be considered that their atoms are q
atoms. this implies that user have to choose q atom so that its
range cover all possible perturbation. subsequently, the parameters
will be compared in different states and only the ones that are 
changing will be printed out to fep file. the proccedure is different
for atom types and charges. all of q atoms type and charge will be
added to fep file (it make it easier to further manipulate the 
fep/EVB if needed and have no effect on final results). the coupling 
will be suggested based on presence of beaking/forming bond in a
angle, torsion and improper. this might be uneccessary sice if an
angle, torsion or improper include a breaking/forming bond, it will 
be set to 0 in coresbonding states. the program can handel more than 
two states; however, the write out format might be messy in case of
more than three states.

# how to compile
qfeper was compiled and tested by ifort and gfortran in linux(ubuntu).
the compile command is as follow

        ifort qfeper_pars.f90  qfeper_analyz.f90 qfeper.f90 -o qfeper
    or
        gfortran qfeper_pars.f90  qfeper_analyz.f90 qfeper.f90 -o qfeper

for developers
        ifort -check all -debug all qfeper_pars.f90  qfeper_analyz.f90 qfeper.f90 -o qfeper
    or
